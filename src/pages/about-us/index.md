        In September 2013, Craig White died of a heroin overdose in a car park
        in Cardiff, he was the brother of Risha Lancaster. Coffee4Craig began as
        a reaction to his death and a desire to make the world a little better
        for those who find themselves on the streets. Risha and Hendrix
        Lancaster started giving out coffee on the streets of Manchester that
        same month and it grew from there. On 28/9/13 Coffee4Craig had their
        first event with City Temple in Cardiff holding a meal to celebrate
        Craig's life for the people who shared the last couple of years with
        him. People who were sleeping on the streets in Cardiff. 


        The demand for hot drinks went above and beyond the initial expectation
        of Risha and Hendrix and they felt a calling into the homelessness
        sector.

        Christmas that year they joined Lifeshare in Manchester for their
        Christmas project and ran a small street kitchen during the night
        through Christmas and New Year. Starting the work they would continue
        with people sleeping on the streets.

        On January 16, 2014, Coffee4Craig started the first static C4C street
        kitchen on Piccadilly Gardens Manchester, with Northwest first aid, this
        became 3 nights a week between 7 pm and 9 pm Sunday, Monday and
        Tuesday.  A food bank was launched in Salford to support street homeless
        people who are living in poverty and those who are at risk of becoming
        homeless. Coffee4Craig launches its 'Education is Key' programme,
        working with young people in schools and universities to educate them on
        the issues surrounding homelessness, food poverty and mental health. 


        Sain and Jake started the Cardiff branch of Coffee4Craig working
        alongside City Temple to provide clothing for people who were Street
        Homeless and also launched a weekly Street kitchen in the town
        centre.<br>


        In November this year, The first Street Store was launched with
        Coffee4Craig (A world initiative to bring dignity of choice to people
        living on the streets).<br>


        Bez became Coffee4Craig Patron.

        2015 Coffee4Craig, Lifeshare, and CAN team together to start COR
        (Coalition of Relief Network.) This forum is for grassroots charities
        and organisations working together to provide sustainable long term
        support for people sleeping on the streets in Greater Manchester. The
        work from this forum has subsequently led to the Manchester Homelessness
        Partnership, the first Manchester Homelessness Charter and Big Change. 


        COR Officially launched on World Homeless Day 15 October joined by MCC,
        The Urban Village Health Center, Breakfast in Bed and Myriad Foundation
        and Steph and Becky who later formed Reach Out To The Community. 

        Street Support Launched. 


        A protest was held in Manchester by people sleeping on the streets and
        tent cities started forming all over the city. 


        Coffee4Craig started to work with Manchester City Council. 


        We still ran our 3 night a week Street kitchen at Piccadilly Not Just
        Soup joined us every Tuesday with different restaurants each week
        providing the food for the street kitchen and the Cardiff team continued
        to run a street kitchen every Wednesday.

        Coffee4Craig started to work with MCC on the Cold Weather Provision
        ensuring people sleeping on the streets got shelter when temperatures
        hit zero and below. This started a president and Coffee4Craig are now
        prevalent in the Homelessness Out Of Hours Cities Response Extreme
        Weather. 

        Manchester's Homelessness Charter was born and the Homelessness
        Partnership. This was to help improve homelessness in Manchester
        bringing together the charities and organisations and people who are
        homeless working together. From here several Action groups were formed
        to improve services and get voices heard. We formed the Evening
        Provision Action Group alongside Barnabus, MCC and Reach Out to The
        Community to discuss how we could provide a 7 evening a week provision
        for the city. The Big Change was Launched to provide a fund for the
        smaller charities to provide essential items deposits etc for peoples
        first steps away from the street. 

        Coffee4Craig moved from Picadilly to the back of Manchester Cathedral in
        September along with NorthWest FirstAid, Not Just Soup, Myriad 
        Foundation, SPIN and VOW. Together we provided a street kitchen 7
        evenings a week for people sleeping on the streets. 

        We also launched an Evening Provision from the YPFS building every
        Sunday evening,  we had started to take our service indoors. 

        Coffee4Craig continues to provide a street kitchen in Cardiff and start
        to work with a charity shop in Barry named Craigs Corner partnering up
        with a community hub.
