        Sept 2013, Craig White died of a heroin overdose in a car park in
        Cardiff, he was the brother of Risha Lancaster, one of the Coffee4Craig
        founders, Coffee4Craig began as a reaction to his death and a desire to
        make the world a little better for those who find themselves on the
        streets. Risha and Hendrix Lancaster started giving out coffee on the
        streets of Manchester that same month and it grew from there. The demand
        for hot drinks went above and beyond the initial expectation of Risha
        and Hendrix and they felt a calling into the homelessness sector. With a
        small group of volunteers and supporters starting to grow, we developed
        an outdoor 'street kitchen' three evenings a week in Piccadilly Gardens.

        Coffee4Craig, Lifeshare, and CAN team together to start Coalition of
        Relief Network.  This forum is for grassroots charities and
        organisations to work together and support each other in providing a
        better service for rough sleepers. The work from this forum has
        subsequently led to the Manchester Homelessness Partnership and the
        first Manchester Homelessness Charter.
         
        Coffee4Craig launches a food bank in Salford to support people who are
        living in poverty and those who are at risk of becoming homeless.
         
        Coffee4Craig launches its 'Education is Key' programme, working with
        young people in schools and universities to educate them on the issues
        surrounding homelessness, food poverty and mental health. 
         
        In 2014, there were 47 rough sleepers in Manchester.
