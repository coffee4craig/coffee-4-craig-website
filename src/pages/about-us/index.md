        In September 2013, Craig White died of a heroin overdose in a car park
        in Cardiff, he was the brother of Risha Lancaster. Coffee4Craig began as
        a reaction to his death and a desire to make the world a little better
        for those who find themselves on the streets. Risha and Hendrix
        Lancaster started giving out coffee on the streets of Manchester that
        same month and it grew from there. On 28/9/13 Coffee4Craig had their
        first event with City Temple in Cardiff holding a meal to celebrate
        Craig's life for the people who shared the last couple of years with
        him. People who were sleeping on the streets in Cardiff. 


        The demand for hot drinks went above and beyond the initial expectation
        of Risha and Hendrix and they felt a calling into the homelessness
        sector.

        Christmas that year they joined Lifeshare in Manchester for their
        Christmas project and ran a small street kitchen during the night
        through Christmas and New Year. Starting the work they would continue
        with people sleeping on the streets.

        Coffee4Craig, Lifeshare, and CAN team together to start Coalition of
        Relief Network.  This forum is for grassroots charities and
        organisations to work together and support each other in providing a
        better service for people sleeping on the streets. The work from this
        forum has subsequently led to the Manchester Homelessness Partnership
        and the first Manchester Homelessness Charter.
         
        Coffee4Craig launches a food bank in Salford to support street homeless
        people who are living in poverty and those who are at risk of becoming
        homeless.
         
        Coffee4Craig launches its 'Education is Key' programme, working with
        young people in schools and universities to educate them on the issues
        surrounding homelessness, food poverty and mental health. 
         
        In 2014, there were 47 people sleeping on the streets in Manchester.

        In 2015 we moved to The Cathedral with SPIN (Supported People In Need),
        VOW, Not Just Soup and Myriad Foundation.


        Here we provided a 7-night-a-week street kitchen, which lead the way for
        moving indoors.

        Coffee4Craig partners with Centre Point North to provide an indoor
        provision one night a week, whilst still providing an outdoor provision
        six days a week at the Cathedral with SPIN (Supported People In Need),
        VOW, Not Just Soup and Myriad Foundation.


        This set us up to move full time into an indoor provision, seven days a
        week the following year.
