    <b>We need a team of volunteers every day at our drop-in center on Oldham
    Street in Manchester. The roles include; cooking, sorting collections,
    giving out hot drinks and food, keeping the kitchen clean and tidy, greeting
    at reception, monitoring the shower list and sitting down with guests for a
    brew and a chat!</b>

    <br>

    <br>

    We also need help behind the scenes with lots of different things like
    sorting through donations, keeping the food bank organised, sending
    newsletters and thanks yous. Maybe you have a skill that we could use?

        ‘I enjoy the support we give the homeless, it is such a good feeling
        when I pass a homeless person and they say “I know you” and it’s because
        I have helped them at street kitchens with Coffee4Craig.’

        ‘Starting Coffee4Craig with Hendrix was the only way I could deal with
        the loss of my younger brother Craig. I couldn’t watch other people in
        this situation without help. I couldn’t walk past blindly anymore,
        neither of us could.’
