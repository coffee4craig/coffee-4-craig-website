  A smile can go a long way, if you pass anyone in the city, whoever they are,
  smile and say hello. You never know what kind of day someone is having and it
  might make a difference.

    We need a team of volunteers every day at our drop-in centre in Manchester.
    The roles include; cooking, sorting collections, giving out hot drinks and
    food, keeping the kitchen clean and tidy, greeting at reception, monitoring
    the shower list, and sitting down with guests for a brew and a chat! We also
    need help behind the scenes with lots of different things like sorting
    through donations, keeping the food bank organised, sending newsletters and
    thank yous. Maybe you have a skill that we could use?

        ‘I enjoy the support we give the homeless, it is such a good feeling
        when I pass a homeless person and they say “I know you” and it’s because
        I have helped them at street kitchens with Coffee4Craig.’

        heartwarming. The whole team do more than just provide food to the
        vulnerable they give hope and try to build a future.’

        ‘Starting Coffee4Craig with Hendrix was the only way I could deal with
        the loss of my younger brother Craig. I couldn’t watch other people in
        this situation without help. I couldn’t walk past blindly anymore,
        neither of us could.’
