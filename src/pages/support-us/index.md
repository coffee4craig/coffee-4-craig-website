    Each evening we operate an out of hours’ drop-in service in the heart of
    Manchester city centre. We offer hot food, food parcels, showers, medical
    support and mental health crisis intervention. 

    We need a team of volunteers every day to help run our drop-in centre on
    Oldham Street, Manchester. Roles include: cooking; sorting collections;
    giving out hot drinks and food; keeping the kitchen clean; greeting guests
    at reception; monitoring the shower list, and sitting down with our guests
    for a brew and a chat!

    We also need help behind the scenes with lots of different things like
    sorting donations, keeping the food bank organised, sending newsletters and
    thank you letters. If you have a skill that you think could help us, please
    get in touch!

        ‘I enjoy the support we give the homeless, it is such a good feeling
        when I pass a homeless person and they say “I know you” and it’s because
        I have helped them at street kitchens with Coffee4Craig.’

        ‘Starting Coffee4Craig with Hendrix was the only way I could deal with
        the loss of my younger brother Craig. I couldn’t watch other people in
        this situation without help. I couldn’t walk past blindly anymore,
        neither of us could.’
