  A smile can go a long way, if you pass anyone in the city, whoever they are, smile and say hello. You never know what kind of day someone is having and it might make a difference.

    We need a team of volunteers every day at our drop-in centre on Oldham Street in Manchester. The roles include; cooking, sorting collections, giving out hot drinks and food, keeping the kitchen clean and tidy, greeting at reception, monitoring the shower list, and sitting down with guests for a brew and a chat! We also need help behind the scenes with lots of different things like sorting through donations, keeping the food bank organised, sending newsletters and thank yous. Maybe you have a skill that we could use?

        ‘I enjoy the support we give the homeless, it is such a good feeling when I pass a homeless person and they
        say “I know you” and it’s because I have helped them at street kitchens with Coffee4Craig.’

        ‘Watching how passionate they are about helping people in need is heartwarming. The whole team do more than
        just provide food to the vulnerable they give hope and try to build a future.’

        ‘Starting Coffee4Craig with Hendrix was the only way I could deal with the loss of my younger brother Craig. I couldn’t watch other people in this situation without help.
        I couldn’t walk past blindly anymore, neither of us could.’
