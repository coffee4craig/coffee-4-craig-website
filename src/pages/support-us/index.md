    <b>We are dependant on volunteers.<br></b>

    <br>

    Every day at The Meanwhile evening drop-in out team of volunteers support
    serving food, washing up, sorting collections, a bit more washing up, 
    keeping the kitchen clean and tidy (which includes washing up), greeting
    guests (in between rounds of washing up), supporting guests to access
    showers (and wondering how much how washing up has piled up),  and sitting
    down with guests for a brew and a chat, to whinge about how their hands are
    sore from washing up!</b>

    <br>

    <br>

    <b>We also need help behind the scenes with lots of different things like
    sorting through donations, keeping the food stores organised, and much more!
    Maybe you have a skill that we could use? </b>

        ‘I enjoy the support we give the homeless, it is such a good feeling
        when I pass a homeless person and they say “I know you” and it’s because
        I have helped them at street kitchens with Coffee4Craig.’

        ‘Starting Coffee4Craig with Hendrix was the only way I could deal with
        the loss of my younger brother Craig. I couldn’t watch other people in
        this situation without help. I couldn’t walk past blindly anymore,
        neither of us could.’
