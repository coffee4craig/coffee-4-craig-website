        There are masses of reasons, everything from a relationship breakdown,
        rent arrears, benefit stoppages, prison release right through to loosing
        employment and becoming unwell and a lack of support network. 
      title: Why do people become homeless?
    - description: >-
        The best thing you can do is volunteer. We're always looking or check
        out streetsupport.net for lots more opportunities.
      title: 'I want to help the homeless, what can I do to help?'
    - description: >-
        We are always looking for willing volunteers, but we do have a process
        due to the nature of the service we offer. You will need to complete an
        induction and DBS check.

        If you've got some mens clothing in small sizes below 34" or medium,
        we'd love you to get in touch to arrange dropping off. 
      title: 'Can I drop off clothes? '

        If you check out streetsupport.net there is a list of all the services
        and a help section.

        I've come across someone homeless, is there anywhere I can send them for
        help? 
    - description: >-
        In short, no. The ABEN, A bed every night, does not charge anyone to
        stay there. The emergency cold weather shelters do not charge. The
        supported accommodation do not charge. Most hostels, hotels, B&Bs and
        guest houses require ID and most people we work with do not have ID. 
      title: Do people have to pay for hostels?
    - description: >-
        Yes, you can use any of the homeless services as a care of address and a
        post office account to have benefits paid into.
