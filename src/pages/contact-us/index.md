        There are masses of reasons, everything from a relationship breakdown,
        rent arrears, benefit stoppages, prison release right through to losing
        employment and becoming unwell and a lack of support network.

        In short, no. The ABEN (A Bed Every Night), does not charge anyone to
        stay there.


        The emergency cold weather shelters do not charge. The supported
        accommodation do not charge. Most hostels, hotels, B&Bs and guest houses
        require ID and most people we work with do not have ID. 


        Please note that certain hostels may charge a monthly surcharge. 
      title: Do people have to pay for hostels?
    - description: >-
        Yes, you can use any of the homeless services as a care-of address, as
        well as the Job Centre. 


        We work with the Street Engagement Hub to help guests open a bank
        account and obtain ID.
